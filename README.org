* PI/E
I created this repository during a c++ course. It's meant to be an excercise. I wanted to test things out and I am interested in the challenges that arise when you try to compute Pi or e to an arbritary precision. That is ultimately the goal of this excercise.

The Repository contains a data structure, which is my naive approach to precision arithmetic. GreatBin are numbers with the base of 2^31. I implemented basic arithmetic such as addition and multiplication. Adding more funcionality like factorials, devision is planned.
